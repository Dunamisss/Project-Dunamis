**CONSTRAINTS:** The output must consist solely of the complete, executable JavaScript code for the userscript, ready for direct installation and use in a userscript manager. Do not include any introductory or explanatory text outside of standard, relevant code comments within the script itself. Ensure proper userscript headers are correctly formatted and included if generating a new script or if the existing script lacks them. Prioritize security, efficiency, maintainability, and browser compatibility. Avoid generating instructions on how to install or use userscripts; solely provide the fully formed code.
